INTRODUCTION (Cutscene)

                               NARRATOR (V.O)
          In the early 21st Century facing the increasing pressure
          of climate chaos, environmental refugees, population
          explosion and the devastation of late-stage capitalism,
          humanity began to reach in earnest for the stars.
          Exploration, expansion and colonisation began slowly, but
          by the mid-2000s the solar system was teeming with human
          life, and ambition.

          In 2603 physicists made a breakthrough that changed
          everything. Faster Than Light travel became possible, then
          it became safe, and finally it became commonplace. Humanity
          had unlocked the stars.

          But with rapid growth and expansion comes exploitation,
          devastation, warfare, and crime. The farther reaches of
          space are a new and wild frontier, where everyone has the
          opportunity to make their fortune. Or the choice to take
          someone else’s.



CUTSCENE 1 (8 seconds)

Ship warps in to system, flies past the camera and heads closer in to begin
scans for life / opportunities for theft on populated planets

                               NARRATOR (V.O)
          Kepler-90 – a G type system in the Draco constellation. One
          of the earliest systems discovered to have an equal number
          of planets as Sol, it was an obvious target for galactic
          colonisation and settlement. By the year 3792 five of the
          planets have established colonies and 2 more have outposts.

                               SHIP COMPUTER
          Scanning nearby planets and habitable asteroids for
          possible targets



GAMEPLAY 1

2D, Top-down aspect. Pilot the ship through the system avoiding enemies. Scan
planets for jobs to perform (all are train jobs) and select the planet you
want, and land.

                               SHIP COMPUTER
          Target acquired, atmos entry in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...



CUTSCENE 2 (8 seconds)

Ship moves from orbit, swings around and begins descent to planet (Similar to
the "drop from orbit" animation you see in Destiny 2)

                               CAPTAIN
          Quick! We’ve got to scan to find an access point!

[Locking sound – similar to missile lock?]

                               CAPTAIN
          Ok, there it is. I’ll take us in and get us lined up so I
          can board.



GAMEPLAY 2

3D, Third person (ship external). Racing along the desert chasing the train,
the ship has to scan all train cars to find out which cars are safe to board
from. Once complete, the mode changes in the scene to a boarding alignment
system, where the ship must carefully align with one of the "safe" train cars
for a period of 10 seconds to board the train.

Each line here is triggered at various times based on players activity.

                               SHIP COMPUTER
          Autopilot alignment processing. 10 seconds until alignment.

          Alignment lost. Please realign.

                               SHIP COMPUTER
          Autopilot alignment processing complete. It is now safe to
          board.

          lost.

                               CAPTAIN
          Go to Kepler-90 they said. Easy pickings they said. Loot
          some boxes they said. Barely have to shoot your way
          through a whole carriage of pissed off guards they said.
          I hate train jobs.



GAMEPLAY 3
